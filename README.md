## Quick start - Run it yourself

*Please note that this project is still under active development and is in an early alpha state.*

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

### Run the webapp

1. Download the latest webapp snapshot jar of the validator from the [webapp package](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/packages/1268975).
1. From the command line run `java -jar {JAR file name}`, where `{JAR file name}` is the name of the file you downloaded in the previous step. For example, if the JAR file name is `gtfs-realtime-validator-webapp-1.0.0-20220223.003109-1.jar`, you would run `java -jar gtfs-realtime-validator-webapp-1.0.0-20220223.003109-1.jar`.
1. When prompted, in your browser go to `http://localhost:8080`
1. Enter your [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)-realtime](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) and [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) feed URLs and click "Start".  Example feeds:
    * HART (Tampa, FL)
        * GTFS Realtime - http://api.tampa.onebusaway.org:8088/trip-updates
        * GTFS - http://gohart.org/google/google_transit.zip
    * MBTA (Boston, MA)
        * GTFS Realtime - https://cdn.mbta.com/realtime/TripUpdates.pb
        * GTFS - https://cdn.mbta.com/MBTA_GTFS.zip
    * ...more at [OpenMobilityData.org](https://openmobilitydata.org/search?q=gtfsrt)


### Run batch validation

See the [batch processing](gtfs-realtime-validator-lib/README.md#batch-processing) section of the [**gtfs-realtime-validator-lib** README](gtfs-realtime-validator-lib/README.md).

## Rules

* [Implemented rules](RULES.md)
* [Planned future rules](https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/gtfs-realtime-validator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+rule%22)

Have a suggestion for a new rule?  Open an issue with the ["new rule" label](https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/gtfs-realtime-validator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+rule%22).  You can see the complete process for adding new rules on the [Adding new rules](ADDING_NEW_RULES.md) page.
 
## Building the project 

There are two components to this project:
* **gtfs-realtime-validator-lib** - The core library that implements GTFS Realtime [validation rules](RULES.md) as well as [batch processing mode](gtfs-realtime-validator-lib/README.md#batch-processing).  You can use this same library [in your own project](gtfs-realtime-validator-lib/README.md#using-validation-rules-or-the-batch-processor-in-your-project).
* **gtfs-realtime-validator-webapp** - A server and website that allows multiple users to validate GTFS-relatime feeds by simply entering URLs into the website.

The main **gtfs-realtime-validator-webapp** user interface is implemented as a web application, with the backend code written in Java.  An instance of the [Jetty embedded server](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) is used to run the application, with [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) used for data persistence.

#### Prerequisites 

Following are the requirements to build and run the project from source code: 

* [Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

#### 1. Build the project 

From the command-line, run:

`mvn package`

This will generate an executable file in the `gtfs-realtime-validator-webapp/target/` directory with all the dependencies needed to run the web application.

Note that this might take a while - this project also builds and packages the [gtfs-validator](https://github.com/conveyal/gtfs-validator) so a static GTFS validation report can be seen within the GTFS-rt validator tool.
 
If you're going to be rebuilding the project frequently (e.g., editing source code), we suggest you load the project as Maven project in an IDE like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/).

#### 2. Run the application

To start up the server so you can view the web interface, from the command-line, run: 

* `java -jar {JAR file name}`, where `{JAR file name}` is the name of the file you downloaded previously. For example, if the JAR file name is `gtfs-realtime-validator-webapp-1.0.0-20220223.003109-1.jar`, you would run `java -jar gtfs-realtime-validator-webapp-1.0.0-20220223.003109-1.jar`.


You should see some output, and a message saying `Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser`.

#### 3. View the application 

Once the application has been started, you can enter URLs for the feeds you'd like to have validated at:
 
 http://localhost:8080
 
## Configuration options

See our [Configuration Guide](CONFIG.md) for various configuration options, including changing the port number that the server runs on, what database it connects to, and more.

Note that the validator also has a [batch processing mode](gtfs-realtime-validator-lib/README.md#batch-processing) - see the [**gtfs-realtime-validator-lib** README](gtfs-realtime-validator-lib/README.md).
 
## Docker
### Setup
1. Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
2. `docker pull ghcr.io/mobilitydata/gtfs-realtime-validator` to get the latest snapshot version of the validator. You can look at other Docker images for this project [here](https://github.com/orgs/MobilityData/packages/container/package/gtfs-realtime-validator).

Or, build the image yourself using the following:

`docker build -t gtfs-realtime-validator .`

### Run

`docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/mobilitydata/gtfs-realtime-validator`

Then go to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## MobilityData Release Process

**Snapshots**

We've set up a Maven repository on GitHub Packages to hold the snapshot artifacts from this project - [GTFS Realtime Validator Packages](https://github.com/orgs/MobilityData/packages?repo_name=gtfs-realtime-validator). The GitHub Action [`test_package.yml`](../.github/workflows/test_package.yml) publishes to this repository.

NOTE: You need to [authenticate with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token) to download the below artifacts

If you want to include snapshot releases in your project, you'll need to add the following to the `pom.xml` of the project you want to use it in:

## Projects based on this validator
- [**transport.data.gouv.fr - Online GTFS Realtime validation**](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/validation?type=gtfs-rt) - A website by the [French national access point to transport data](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/) that allows users to enter GTFS and GTFS Realtime URLs for validation. The [gtfs-realtime-validator batch processor](gtfs-realtime-validator-lib/README.md#batch-processing) is then run by transport.data.gouv.fr and the results displayed on the website. Their project is [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/etalab/transport-site).
- [**CalTrans California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP) GTFS Realtime validation**](https://dot.ca.gov/cal-itp/Critical-GTFS-Validation-Errors) - Cal-ITP is using the [gtfs-realtime-validator batch processor](https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/gtfs-realtime-validator/compare/master...MobilityData:gtfs-realtime-validator-lib/README.md?expand=1#batch-processing), along with an [open-source Python wrapper they developed](https://github.com/cal-itp/gtfs-rt-validator-api), to validate GTFS Realtime data for transit agencies in the state of California. 
- [**CUTR-at-USF's transit-feed-quality-calculator**](https://github.com/cal-itp/gtfs-rt-validator-api) - An open-source command-line Java application that uses the [gtfs-realtime-validator batch processor](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/pull/gtfs-realtime-validator-lib/README.md#batch-processing) to assess the quality of a large number of transit feeds. It downloads a list of GTFS Realtime feed URLs from [OpenMobilityData](https://openmobilitydata.org/), fetches GTFS Realtime feeds from those agency URLs, runs the [gtfs-realtime-validator batch processor](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/pull/gtfs-realtime-validator-lib/README.md#batch-processing) on all of the downloaded feeds, and then outputs summary statistics and graphs on the results.
- [**Traffic Brain (Japan)**](https://t-brain.jp/) - Runs a [hosted website version](https://gtfs.t-brain.jp/rt-validator/) of the [gtfs-realtime-validator-webapp](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator/pull/gtfs-realtime-validator-webapp/README.md) in this project.
